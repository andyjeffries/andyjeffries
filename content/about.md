Urs HÃ¶lzle famously wrote a "Personal User Manual" that described how he thinks and works best, so that others know how to get the most out of interacting with him. Others have written similar documents as their "Getting to know X 101". This is mine...


## Identity
I use the pronouns he/him, and I'm very informal - I'd much rather people call me Andy in professional environments over Mr Jeffries. If you've read the book "Surrounded by Idiots", I strongly consider myself a Blue - analytical and fact-driven.

I have thick skin and am not easily offended, I'm OK with offensive language and jokes, as long as it's at the right place and time (e.g. in front of investors or customers, probably not the right ones).


## Core values

*Information is key* - My main personal motivator (over money or titles) is knowing things first or at least as soon as possible.

*Trust over micromanagement* - I always want to trust my team and know they'll deliver what they said they will when they said they would - OR that they come back to me before then, so I can help them with whatever's stopping them or at least adjust expectations.

*Planning over Adhoc* - I'd rather have a scheduled time to meet than constant mini-interruptions. My mind works best when given longer periods to focus and get in to flow state and mini-interruptions break that.

*No blame* - If a problem has happened I very rarely care whose fault it was (I don't remember a single situation in my career when I've cared). The only reason I may ask "who did this" is because I want to speak to them to understand from the horse's mouth exactly what went wrong and how. I'm more interested in putting in place processes and procedures as necessary to protect against similar faults.

*Early or Late* - I'm a big fan of punctuality and believe you are either early for a meeting or late, there is no such thing as being on time (because you should have been there early). It's frustrating for me when others are late and annoying to myself if I ever am late, so you know if I am then it's not through pure tardiness.


## Communication
My priority is Slack for informal, WhatsApp for urgent and Email for background-level or longer communications. During calls I prefer to have video turned on, but if people have less than good internet connections, I'm OK with it off (and will switch to video off if the majority of attendees don't have it on).


## Working day
I start work at 6am Monday to Thursday. I use the first 3 hours as a pre-communication focus period, so I'll tend to reply to Slack or emails between 9am and 9:45am (when my first standup is). Fridays I work completely away from communications so tend to start between 8am-9am, although I may also sometimes make use of Civo Summer Fridays.

I finish between 4pm and 6pm each day depending on workload. I generally can focus easier and work harder in the mornings than the evenings, so my brain is often fried towards the end of the day. If you want me to help with something difficult but not urgent, you may be better waiting until the following morning.


## Non-work stufff
I'm a Taekwondo 7th Dan, having done it since I was 12 when I started due to being bullied, and I run a club in Stevenage (we had about 90 active students before Covid hit, we're now building back up again, currently at 60).

I can speak Korean, not fluently but to a conversational level. I've been to Korea 7 times in the last 10 years and can cook some Korean food too.

In my spare time I enjoy reading (a LOT), watching movies, playing Apex Legends on a gaming PC and playing Go/Baduk. My favourite books and movies are Star Wars based, but I also like reading other fiction and non-fiction too (often programming or management based).

I'm married to Julie (since 2001) and have two kids Tom (born in 2002) and Jen (born in 2005).
