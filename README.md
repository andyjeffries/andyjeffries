# Hi, I'm Andy 👋 from 🇬🇧

### I'm a self-taught developer with many years experience across a range of industries, but recently spending my time leading teams (although I still like to stay active in coding).

- 🌱 Learning all the changes in [Ruby on Rails 7](https://rubyonrails.org/2021/12/15/Rails-7-fulfilling-a-vision) (really nice to have [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) integrated as I ❤️ Tailwind!)
- 🛠 Maintaining [Flexirest](https://github.com/flexirest/flexirest) a really flexible Ruby library for accessing Rest APIs in an ActiveModel like style.
